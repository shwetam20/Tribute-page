        <h3>Here's a time line of Mahatma Gandhi's life:</h3>
        <ul class="content">
          <li>
            <strong>1869</strong> - Born on 2nd October which is recognised as
            International Day of Non-Violence. His was named Mohandas Karamchand
            Gandhi and was later called Mahatma Gandhi meaning "Great soul" by
            the people who viewed him as India's national and spiritual leader.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1882</strong> - Gandhi, only 13 years old, marries Kasturba
            Kapadia, who is also 13. Kasturba will later participate in a number
            of her husband’s civil disobedience campaigns.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1888</strong> - Gandhi studies law in London. He is
            introduced to the Bible and to the Bhagavadgita, which he reads for
            the first time in its English translation by Sir Edwin Arnold.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1893</strong> - Gandhi takes a job with an Indian law firm
            in South Africa, where he is quickly exposed to the racial
            discrimination practiced there. He settles in Durban and begins to
            practice law. In 1894 he founds the Natal Indian Congress to agitate
            for Indian rights.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1906</strong> - A discriminatory law is passed in the
            Transvaal region of South Africa forcing all Indians to register
            with the provincial government or else face punishment. Under
            Gandhi’s leadership the Indian community takes a pledge to defy the
            law and to suffer all the penalties resulting from its defiance.
            This practice becomes known as satyagraha, a technique for
            redressing wrongs through inviting, rather than inflicting,
            suffering, for resisting adversaries without rancor, and fighting
            them without violence.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1915</strong> - Gandhi returns to India and in 1919 he
            becomes a leader in the Indian National Congress political party. He
            campaigns for swaraj, or “self-rule.” In 1920 he launches a
            noncooperation campaign against Britain, urging Indians to spin
            their own cotton and to boycott British goods, courts, and
            government. This leads to his imprisonment from 1922 to 1924.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1930</strong> - Gandhi leads tens of thousands of Indians on
            a 240-mile (385-kilometer) march to the sea to collect their own
            salt. The march is a protest against a British tax on salt and
            results in 60,000 people being arrested.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1942</strong> - Gandhi, who in 1934 had resigned as leader
            and member of the Indian National Congress, becomes politically
            active again early in World War II, demanding immediate independence
            as India’s price for aiding Britain in the war. He is imprisoned
            again, from 1942 to 1944.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1947</strong> - India formally achieves independence from
            British rule on 15 August, 1947. However, the partition of the
            subcontinent into India and Pakistan is a great disappointment to
            Gandhi, who has long worked for Hindu-Muslim unity. Rioting between
            Muslims and Hindus over the partition breaks out in many areas.
            Again Gandhi turns to nonviolence, fasting until Delhi rioters
            pledge peace.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1948</strong> - While on his way to prayer in Delhi, Gandhi
            is killed by a young Hindu fanatic who has been angered by Gandhi’s
            efforts to reconcile Hindus and Muslims.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="quote">
          "Friends and comrades, the light has gone out of our lives, and there
          is darkness everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or
          how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father
          of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that;
          nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these
          many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him,
          and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and
          millions in this country."
